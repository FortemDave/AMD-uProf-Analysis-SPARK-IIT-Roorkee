Visualize

Predict IPC: Use all other stats to predict
Build a GUI to show all the Stats
Possible Candidate: Tensorboard. 


Start with the ML part
NLP + Timeseries

IPC from other data.

Cache Hit rates w.r.t differnet kind of accesses
Demand, Prefetch Access

Memory Bandwidth

IPC, Branch Misprediction Ratio
All access, misses, PTI values not ratios HWPF (Hardware Pre Fetch) (L1,L2,DC/IC)


Leave aside L1, consier only L2 and L3
DC/IC 

Memory

direct application: Timeseries analysis of memory bandwidth. 
How it's varying with time and multiple


Utility: Cloud Service Providers.

RTL implementations
===============================================
Qualcomm Lab: Prediction of Perf of Next Gen Processors
probably use GEM5

Why not start using UCC. Early Stage as of now.
Model starts working on that.
