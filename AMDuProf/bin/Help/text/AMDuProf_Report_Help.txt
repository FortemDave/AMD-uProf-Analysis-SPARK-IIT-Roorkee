NAME
       AMDuProfCLI  report - Read collected data files (created by AMDuProfCLI
       collect) and generate the profile report.

SYNOPSIS
       AMDuProfCLI report [<options>]


DESCRIPTION
       This report command process the profile-data  file  and  generates  the
       profile report.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Displays this help information.

       -i, --input-dir <directory-path>
              Path to the directory containing collected data.

       --category <PROFILE>
              Generate report only for specific profiling category. Comma sep-
              arated multiple categories can be specified. If this option  not
              used,  then  report  for all categories gets generated. Multiple
              instance of --category is allowed. Supported categories are:

              ?  cpu - Generate report specific to CPU Profiling

              ?  mpi - Generate report specific to MPI Tracing

              ?  openmp - Generate report specific to OpenMP Tracing

              ?  os - Generate report specific to OS Tracing

              ?  gputrace - Generate report specific to GPU Tracing

              ?  gpuprof - Generate report specific to GPU Profiling

              Example:

              ?  --category cpu,mpi,os,gputrace,gpuprof

              ?  --category mpi --category cpu --category os  --category  gpu-
                 trace --category gpuprof

       --detail
              Generate detailed report.

       -p, --pid <PID,..>
              Generate report for the specified PID. Process IDs are separated
              by comma.

       -g     Print callstack. Use with options --detail or --pid  (-p).  With
              --pid (-p)  option callstack will be generated only if the spec-
              ified PIDs contains callstack samples.

       --host <host-name>
              This option is used along with the --input-dir option.  Generate
              report belonging to a specific host. Supported options are:

              ?  <hostname>: Report process belonging to a specific host.

              ?  all: Report all processes

              Note: If --host is not used then only the processes belonging to
              the system from which report is generated is  reported.  Incase,
              the  system  is a master node in a cluster, then the report will
              be generated for the lexicographically first host in that  clus-
              ter.

       --group-by <section>
              Specify the report to be generated. Supported options are:

              ?  process: Report process details.

              ?  module: Report module details.

              ?  thread: Report thread.

              Default will be group-by process.

       --view <view-config>
              Report  only  the  events  present in the given view-config. Use
              command 'info --list view-configs' to get the list of  supported
              view configurations.

       --disasm
              Generate detailed function report with assembly instructions.

       --disasm-only
              Generate function report with only assembly instructions.

       --show-sys-src
              Generate  detailed  function  report  of system module functions
              with source statements.

       --inline
              Inline function extraction for C, C++ executables.

              Note: If you are interested in the inlined functions, then use this option.


       --sort-by <EVENT>
              Specify the Timer, PMC or IBS event on which the  reported  pro-
              file  data  will  be  sorted with arguments in the form of comma
              separated key=value pairs. Supported keys are:

              ?  event=<timer | ibs-fetch | ibs-op> or <pmu-event> or  <cache-
                 line-event>

              ?  umask=<unit-mask>

              ?  user=<0 | 1>

              ?  os=<0 | 1>

              ?  cmask=<count-mask>

              ?  inv=<0 | 1>

              Use  command 'info --list cacheline-events' for the list of sup-
              ported Cacheline events.

              Use command 'info --list pmu-events' for the list  of  supported
              PMC events. Details about the arguments:

              ?  umask  - Unit mask in decimal or hexadecimal. Applicable only
                 to PMC events.

              ?  cmask - Count mask in decimal or hexadecimal. Applicable only
                 to PMC events.

              ?  user,os,inv  -  User,  OS mode, Invert count mask. Applicable
                 only to PMC events.

              Multiple occurrences of --sort-by (-s) are not allowed.

       --time-filter <T1:T2>
              Restricts report generation to the time interval between T1  and
              T2, where T1, T2 are time in seconds from profile start time.

       --agg-interval <INTERVAL>
              Accumulation  of samples for the given INTERVAL in milliseconds.
              Default INTERVAL is 1 second. If the interval value set to 0  or
              negative,  granularity of the data aggregation would be the com-
              plete profile duration.

       --imix Report Instruction Mix (only for native binaries).

       --ignore-system-module
              Ignore samples from System Modules.

       --show-percentage
              Show samples in percentages.

       --show-sample-count
              Show the number of samples. This option is enabled by default.

       --show-event-count
              Show number of events occurred.

       --bin-path <path>
              Binary file path. Multiple use of --bin-path is allowed.

       --src-path <path>
              Source file path. Multiple use of --src-path is allowed.

       --symbol-path <path>
              Debug symbol path. Multiple use of --symbol-path is allowed.

       --cutoff <n>
              Cutoff to limit the number  of  process,  modules,  threads  and
              functions  to  be reported. 'n' is the minimum number of entries
              to be reported in various report sections. Default value is 10.

       --show-all-cachelines
              Show all cachelines in report sections for  cache  analysis.  By
              default only cachelines accessed by more than one process/thread
              are listed.

       --log-path <path-to-log-dir>
              Specify the path to where log file should be  created.  If  this
              option  is not provided, by default the log file will be created
              either in path set by AMDUPROF_LOGDIR  environment  variable  or
              $TEMP  path.   The  log  file  name will be of the format $USER-
              AMDuProfCLI.log.

       --enable-log
              Use this option to enable additional logging with log file.

       --enable-logts
              Use this option to capture the timestamp  of  the  log  records.
              This option should be used together with --enable-log option.

       --funccount-interval  <funccount-interval> Specify the time interval in
       seconds to list the function count detail report. If this option is not
       specified,  function  count  will be generated for entire profile dura-
       tion.

       --report-output <path>
              Use this option to write a report to file. If  the  path  has  a
              ".csv"  extension,  the path is assumed to be a file path and is
              used unchanged.  If the ".csv" extension is not used,  the  path
              is assumed to be a directory and the report file is generated in
              the directory with the default name.

       --stdout
              Use this option to print the report in stdout.

       --retranslate
              Use this option to perform the re-translation of collected  data
              files possibly with different set of translation options.

PREDEFINED VIEW CONFIGURATIONS
       A  view  configuration (view-config) is a set of sampled event data and
       computed performance metrics displayed in the text report generated  by
       the  CLI.  Each predefined profile configuration (collect-config) has a
       list of associated predefined views like: ipc_assess - To find hotspots
       with  low  instruction  level parallelism. Provides performance indica-
       tors- IPC and CPI.

ENVIRONMENT
       AMDUPROF_LOGDIR
              If AMDUPROF_LOGDIR is set, its value is used as the path to cre-
              ate log file.
